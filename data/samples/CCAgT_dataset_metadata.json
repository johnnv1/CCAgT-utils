The images were obtained from examinations that were performed on women who were treated at the Gynecology and Colposcopy Outpatient Clinic of the University Hospital Professor Polydoro Ernani de São Thiago of Federal University of Santa Catarina (HU-UFSC). These women, presenting cytological alterations in the oncotic cytology of previous exams, were referred to the [Ane Francyne Costa](https://repositorio.ufsc.br/handle/123456789/191940) for a gynecological exam, colposcopy and biopsy. This research was approved by the UFSC Research Ethics Committee (CEPSH), protocol number 57423616.3.0000.0121. All participating patients were previously approached and informed about the study objectives. Those who agreed to participate signed an Informed Consent Form.",
